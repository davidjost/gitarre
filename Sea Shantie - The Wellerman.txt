Capo 3rd

[Verse Kiffness]
   Am
There once was a ship stuck at sea
         Dm                      Am
And the name of the ship was Evergreen
     Am
The cranes they pulled, and the tugboats pushed
    E                   Am
That ship was stuck in tow

[Chorus]
 F            C
Soon may the Evergreen come
    Dm                      Am
And bring our packages from amazon
F                  C
One day, when the tuggin is done,
       E                 Am
that ship will leave and go

[Verse Kiffness]
   Am
That boat was stuck for a week or more
         Dm           Am
When finally it was freed from shore
     Am
The captain was relieved and swore
    E                   Am
Your phone will come the morrow

[Chorus]
 F            C
Soon may the Evergreen come
    Dm                      Am
And bring our packages from amazon
F                  C
One day, when the tuggin is done,
       E                 Am
that ship will leave and go

[Verse 1]
   Am
There once was a ship that put to sea
         Dm                      Am
And the name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
     Am
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down
    E                   Am
O blow, my bully boys, blow

[Chorus]
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                  C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go

[Verse 2]
    Am
She had not been two weeks from shore
      Dm            Am
When down on her a right whale bore
     Am
The captain called all hands and swore
      E                 Am
He'd take that whale in tow
 
[Chorus]
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                  C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
 
[Verse 3]
   Am
Before the boat had hit the water
      Dm              Am
The whale's tail came up and caught her
     Am
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
      E               Am
When she dived down below
 
[Chorus]
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go

[Verse 4]
    Am
No line was cut, no whale was freed;
     Dm                Am
The Captain's mind was not of greed
    Am
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;
     E                Am
She took the ship in tow

[Chorus]
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
 
[Verse 5]
     Am
For forty days, or even more
     Dm                    Am
The line went slack, then tight once more
     Am
All boats were lost there were only four
      E                  Am
But still that whale did go
 
[Chorus]
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
 
[Verse 6]
   Am
As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;
     Dm                     Am
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
     Am
The Wellerman makes his regular call
     Dm                    Am
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all

[Chorus]
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am Asus2
We’ll take our leave and go
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
