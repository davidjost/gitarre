[Intro]
D#m  C#  G#  B  A#  x2

[Verse]
        D#m                  C#
Did you get my message, the one I left
            G#                      B
While I was trying to condense everything
       A#         D#m                   C#
That I meant in a minute or less when I called to confess
          G#                   B       A#
And make all of my stresses go bye-bye

        D#m                  C#
Did you get my message, you didn't guess
            G#                                    B        A#
'cuz if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
             D#m
And we could give it a rest
          C#
'stead of beating my breast
        G#                    B        A#
Making all of the pressure go sky-high

[Pre-Chorus]
G#                                       C#
  Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
        D#m                          C#
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
    G#                 B                      G#m
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
                         C#                       G#
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent
 
[Chorus]
        B                         G#
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
        B                 G#
Did you get my message,
        B                               G#    C#
Did you get my message, yeah, oooh oooh ooooh hooo

[Verse]
D#m      C#                         G#
  Uh oh, where did it go, must have bypassed your phone
                 B         A#
And flown right out of the window
D#m          C#
  ooh well, how can I tell?
         G#                         B             A#
Should I call the operator or maybe she knows the info
   D#m                  C#                      G#            B    A#
Or whether or not if my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
            D#m
Why not try this for a fact
           C#                 G#
Should you ever call back I'd relax and be relieved
          B       A#
of all my panic attacks

[Bridge]
F# B    Bm
Ahh hooo oooh x2


[Chorus]
        B                         G#
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
        B                         G#
Did you get my message, Di-di-di-di-di-did you now?
        B                              G#    C#
Did you get my message, yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo

D#m  C#  G#  B  A#  x2

[Verse]
        D#m                 C#
Did you get my message, the one that I left
            G#                      B            A#
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
        D#m                        C#
Now the moment is passed, not much sand in the glass
        G#                  B    A#
And I'm standing to lose my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
G#                                       C#
  Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
        D#m                          C#
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
    G#                  B                     G#m
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
                                        C#                           G#
To the matter of our loves defence, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent
 
[Chorus]
        B                         G#
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh
        B                              G#
Did you get my message, Di-di-di-di-di-did you now
        B                              G#    C#
Did you get my message, yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo

[Ending]
        F#
Did you get my message?
B      Bm
 No, I didn't hear a word you said
        F#
Did you get my message?
B                     Bm
  No, I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
F#           B                   Bm
  Come on and answer the question now
F#                                          B             Bm
I don't hear a thing from you and you keep saying you're coming
    F#
Ah, did you get the message love?
B                   Bm
 That I want to get back with you
        F#
Did you get my message love?
       B                    Bm
That I wanna reconnect with you
        F#
Did you get the message now?
          B                  Bm
I did not hear one thing you send
F#                             B            Bm
Why, did you get the message?
                So why don't you answer your phone?
