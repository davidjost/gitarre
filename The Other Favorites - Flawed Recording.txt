[Intro]
D


[Verse 1]
D                 A
You can't tell me darling
G               D
I treated you unkind
                       A
I was a little rough maybe
G                D
I hope you don't mind


[Chorus]
D                          A
Play a little on my harmonica
                               G
Play a little bit on my old guitar
                                D
It's all the same if you just chill
                                   A
Sit around all day with nothing to do
                             G
And if it's all the same to you
                            D
Just sit a while if you will


[Verse 2]
D                    A
Put my boots on the table
  G                  D
Close my eyes and unwind
                A
People say I'm lazy
G              D
   But I don't mind


[Chorus]
D                          A
Play a little on my harmonica
                              G
Play a little bit on my old guitar
                                D
It's all the same if you just chill
                                   A
Sit around all day with nothing to do
                             G
And if it's all the same to you
                            D
Just sit a while if you will


[Verse 3]
D                   A
Clouds form faces above me
G               D
Faces I never knew
                       A
Yes I said I did not know them
G                 D
Why? Do they know you?


[Chorus]
D                          A
Play a little on my harmonica
                               G
Play a little bit on my old guitar
                                D
It's all the same if you just chill
                                   A
Sit around all day with nothing to do
                             G
And if it's all the same to you
                            D
Just sit a while if you will

D                          A
Play a little on my harmonica
                               G
Play a little bit on my old guitar
                                D
It's all the same if you just chill
                                   A
Sit around all day with nothing to do
                             G
And if it's all the same to you
                            D Dsus4 D
Just sit a while if you will
