[Verse 1]
A                            Bm               A
A billion people died on the news tonight
                             Bm
But not so many cried at the terrible sight
           A
Well mama said
                        C#m
It's just make believe
                                      Bm
You can't believe everything you see

[Chorus]
                                       D           Dm
So baby close your eyes to the lullabies
        A                     Bm
On the news tonight

[Verse 2]
A                                    Bm           A
Who's the one to decide that it would be alright
                            Bm
To put the music behind the news tonight
            A
Well mama said
                                         C#m
You can't believe everything you hear
                              Bm
The diagetic world is so unclear

[Chorus]
                          D        Dm
So baby close your ears
             Bm
On the news tonight
               F#m
On the news tonight

[Verse 3]
Bm                                 F#m
The unobtrusive tones on the news tonight
                  A
And mama said
E
Mmm
A                                                    Bm
Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die
A                                                   Bm
At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes
        A
Mama said
                        C#m
It's just make believe

You cant believe everything you see

[Chorus]
Bm                                       D         Dm
So baby close your eyes to the lullabies
           A                    Bm             A
On the news tonight

Listen to the song for the timing.  Thanks K-C, and Chris for getting
me started on guitar, and helpin a brother out when needed.  Much Love.
Later, Jake.
